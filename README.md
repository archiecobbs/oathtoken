## Overview

**OATH Token** is a free and open-source software token for two-factor authentication on the iPhone. **OATH Token** implements the RFC 4226 [HOTP/OATH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOTP) algorithm standard and is not tied to any proprietary server software.

Multiple tokens are supported and may be fully configured as event-based or time-based. Tokens can be fully edited at any time, until if and when put in "lockdown" mode, after which editing is permanently disabled.

Simple [web-based provisioning](https://github.com/archiecobbs/oathtoken/wiki/WebProvisioning) is supported using custom **oathtoken://** URLs.

**OATH Token** is compatible with the [mod-authn-otp](https://github.com/archiecobbs/mod-authn-otp) Apache authentication module.
